description: |
  Subsurface well data analysis toolkit for loading, processing, and analyzing
  well logs, projects, and formation tops. Built on lasio with enhanced curve
  processing. Use when Claude needs to: (1) Load wells from LAS files with
  metadata, (2) Work with multi-well Projects, (3) Process curves (despike,
  smooth, resample, normalize), (4) Manage formation tops, (5) Export well
  data to DataFrame/LAS/CSV, (6) Perform cross-well analysis and QC.

# welly - Well Data Analysis

## Quick Reference

```python
from welly import Well, Project

# Load single well
w = Well.from_las('well.las')

# Access data
df = w.df()                      # DataFrame
gr = w.data['GR']                # Curve object
values = gr.values               # numpy array
depth = gr.basis                 # depth array

# Well info
print(w.name, w.uwi)
print(w.data.keys())             # Available curves

# Load multiple wells
p = Project.from_las('wells/*.las')
for well in p:
    print(well.name)
```

## Key Classes

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Well` | Single well with curves, location, tops |
| `Project` | Collection of wells for multi-well workflows |
| `Curve` | Log curve with depth basis, units, and processing methods |

## Essential Operations

### Access Curve Data
```python
gr = w.data['GR']
print(gr.mnemonic, gr.units)     # Metadata
print(gr.start, gr.stop, gr.step)  # Depth range
```

### Process Curves
```python
gr = w.data['GR']

# Clean and filter
gr_clean = gr.despike(window=5, z=2)
gr_smooth = gr.smooth(window=11)

# Transform
gr_norm = gr.normalize()         # 0-1 range
gr_resampled = gr.resample(step=0.5)
gr_clipped = gr.clip(top=1500, bottom=2000)
```

### Work with Formation Tops
```python
w.tops = {
    'TopFormationA': 1500.0,
    'TopFormationB': 1750.0,
}

for name, depth in w.tops.items():
    print(f"{name}: {depth} m")
```

### Multi-Well Project
```python
from welly import Project

p = Project.from_las('wells/*.las')
print(f"Loaded {len(p)} wells")

# Filter and analyze
for w in p:
    if 'GR' in w.data:
        print(f"{w.name}: GR mean={w.data['GR'].values.mean():.1f}")
```

### Export Data
```python
# To DataFrame
df = w.df()

# To LAS file
w.to_las('output.las')

# To CSV
df.to_csv('well_data.csv')
```

## Common Curve Mnemonics

| Mnemonic | Description | Units |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| GR | Gamma Ray | GAPI |
| NPHI | Neutron Porosity | v/v |
| RHOB | Bulk Density | g/cc |
| DT | Sonic | us/ft |
| RT/ILD | Deep Resistivity | ohm.m |
| CALI | Caliper | in |

## Tips

1. **Use Project** for multi-well workflows - easier than managing individual files
2. **Check units** - welly tracks units, ensure consistency
3. **Despike before analysis** - remove outliers with `curve.despike()`
4. **Resample to common basis** - use `curve.resample()` for cross-well comparison
5. **welly extends lasio** - all lasio functionality available
